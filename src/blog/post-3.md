If you’re using TypeScript, you’ve likely come across both `type` and `interface`. While they can often be used interchangeably to define the shape of data, there are subtle differences that can affect how and when you use them.

### **What They Have in Common**

Both `type` and `interface` let you describe the structure of objects, functions, or other data shapes. In most day-to-day use cases, either one will get the job done.

### **Key Differences**

| Feature         | `type`                                                        | `interface`                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extension**   | Can combine multiple types using union and intersection (`&`) | Can combine multiple types using union and intersection (`&`) |
| **Merging**     | Cannot be re-declared — it's fixed after definition           | Interfaces with the same name are automatically merged        |
| **Use Case**    | Great for union types, primitives, tuples, etc.               | Ideal for defining object shapes and class contracts          |
| **Flexibility** | More versatile for complex types                              | Better for structural and OO-style designs                    |

### **Which Should You Use?**

- Use **`interface`** when working with objects or class structures.
    
- Use **`type`** when you need unions, intersections, or more flexible combinations.
    

In practice, consistency is more important than perfection. Pick one that fits your style or team conventions — and stick with it.
