For a long time, I’ve wanted a space to document my thoughts, experiments, and progress as I learn modern web development. I’ve tried taking notes in scattered files, tweeting bits of ideas, or just keeping everything in my head—but none of that stuck.

**BunmoDev** is my attempt at creating a digital garden for everything I build and explore.

## 🧠 What This Blog Is About

This isn’t just a blog for tutorials or polished write-ups. It’s a log of experiments, half-working ideas, and personal notes on how I’m learning tools like:

- **Astro** for static sites
- **Bun** for faster JS runtimes
- **Tauri**, **Electron**, and modern dev tools
- And eventually: **Blender**, **Obsidian**, and maybe even **white-hat hacking**

### 🚧 Built in Public

I’m not waiting to be “ready.” I’m building in the open, making mistakes, and sharing the process. If a post helps even one other beginner like me, it’s worth it.

I’ll also share Blender-made visuals, free tools, and anything that makes dev life more fun.

### 💡 What's Next

- Weekly blog drops
- A press kit (yes, even solo devs can have style)
- More experiments with GitHub Pages, automation, and writing with Obsidian

If you're into self-taught dev journeys, lightweight tools, or building things from scratch, you might find something useful here.

Thanks for reading. This is just the beginning.
